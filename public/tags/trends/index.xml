      <description>Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 yearsâ€™ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in {min(year(chart_data\(year))}, only {scales::number(chart_data\)prevalence_index[chart_data\(offence == &amp;#39;Vehicle-related theft&amp;#39; &amp;amp; year(chart_data\)year) == max(year(chart_data$year))])} people were a victim at least once in {max(year(chart_data$year))}.
