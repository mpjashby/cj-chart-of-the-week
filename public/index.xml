      <description>Self-reported drug use has fallen for most of the past 20 years, but in the past six years the use of cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy has increased, particularly among people aged 16–24. However, drug use is still lower now than it was at the turn of the millenium.

      <title>Fewer people are victims of common crimes than 30 years&#39; ago</title>

      <description>Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 years’ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in {min(year(chart_data\(year))}, only {scales::number(chart_data\)prevalence_index[chart_data\(offence == &amp;#39;Vehicle-related theft&amp;#39; &amp;amp; year(chart_data\)year) == max(year(chart_data$year))])} people were a victim at least once in {max(year(chart_data$year))}.

      <description>Men of all ages are more likely to be attacked by strangers than by people they know. Women have a lower risk of being victims of violence than men do, but (except before age 25) are as likely to be attacked by an acquaintance as by a stranger.
