<p>Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 yearsâ€™ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in {min(year(chart_data<span class="math inline">\(year))}, only {scales::number(chart_data\)</span>prevalence_index[chart_data<span class="math inline">\(offence == &#39;Vehicle-related theft&#39; &amp; year(chart_data\)</span>year) == max(year(chart_data$year))])} people were a victim at least once in {max(year(chart_data$year))}.</p>
